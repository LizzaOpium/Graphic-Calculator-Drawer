# Graphic Calculator

# Console Input Format (Most Important Section)

The program works in **interactive mode**: the user enters expressions one by one in the console. Below are **all supported input formats**.

---

## 1. Standard Functions: y = f(x)

You must enter **only the right-hand side** of the function.
Do **NOT** type `y =`.

### Valid examples:

```
x
x**2
x**3 - 2*x
sin(x)
cos(x)
exp(x)
sqrt(x)
sin(x) + x**2
```

### You may use:

**Arithmetic operations:**
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`

**Functions:**
`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `arcsin`, `arccos`, `arctan`,
`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`,
`exp`, `log`, `log10`, `sqrt`, `abs`

**Constants:**
`pi`, `e`

---

## 2. Using the Parameter `p`

You can include the parameter `p` in **any formula**.

### Examples:

```
x + p
p*x
sin(x) + p**2
sqrt(p) + x
p**2
```

If the entered expression contains `p`, the program will additionally ask:

```
Minimum p:
Maximum p:
Number of graphs on the same axes:
```

Then multiple graphs will be plotted for different values of `p`.

### IMPORTANT:

If the expression does **not depend on `x`** (for example: `p**2`, `5`, `3 + p`),
the program will automatically plot a **horizontal line**.

---

## 3. Straight Lines

### Vertical line:

```
x = 3
x = -2
```

### Horizontal line:

```
y = 4
y = -1
```

You can also use the parameter `p`:

```
x = p
y = p**2
```

---

## 4. Circles

Only the **strict format** is supported:

```
(x - a)**2 + (y - b)**2 = R
```

### Examples:

```
(x-1)**2 + (y-2)**2 = 9
(x+2)**2 + (y-3)**2 = 16
x**2 + y**2 = 25
```

Where:

* `a`, `b` — center coordinates
* `R` — radius squared

You can also use `p`:

```
(x - p)**2 + y**2 = 4
```

---

## 5. Squares

Squares are defined using absolute values:

```
abs(x - a) <= d and abs(y - b) <= d
```

### Examples:

```
abs(x) <= 2 and abs(y) <= 2
abs(x-1) <= 3 and abs(y+2) <= 3
```

Where:

* `(a, b)` — square center
* `d` — half of the side length

---

## 6. Adding a Second Graph

After the first graph is built, the program asks:

```
Add a second graph to the same axes? (yes/no):
```

If you answer:

* `yes` / `y` → input for the second graph appears
* `no` → the program immediately displays the result

## Project Information

**Project:** Ladder Geometry Visualizer / Graphic Calculator
**Author:** Alexey Popov

This application visualizes a vertical ladder-like structure made of wooden beams and horizontal platforms using coordinate-based geometry. The project is implemented in Python and distributed as a standalone Windows executable (.exe).

The program is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how geometric objects can be constructed and visualized using numerical methods.

---

## Project Description

The program builds a 2D geometric projection of the following structure:

* 4 vertical wooden beams
* Each beam has a height of **1.8 meters**
* The distance between neighboring beams is **0.2 meters**
* 6 horizontal platforms
* Platforms are placed every **0.2 meters** in height
* All platforms connect all four beams

The result is a clear geometric model that resembles a ladder or scaffolding structure.

---

## Purpose of the Project

* Visual demonstration of geometry using coordinates
* Demonstration of numerical model construction
* Practice with plotting and scaling
* Visualization of real-world structures in a mathematical form
* Easy conversion into an executable (.exe) file

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3** — main programming language
* **matplotlib.pyplot** — used for drawing the figure
* **numpy** — used for numerical arrays and clean range generation

---

## How the Structure is Built

### Vertical Beams

* Height: 1.8 meters
* X coordinates: `0`, `0.2`, `0.4`, `0.6`
* Each beam is drawn as a vertical line segment

### Horizontal Platforms

* First platform at height `0.2 m`
* Step size: `0.2 m`
* Total: 6 platforms
* Each platform connects all beams from `x = 0` to `x = 0.6`

---

## Axis Settings and Visualization

* Equal scaling on both axes
* Grid enabled
* Correct proportional geometry
* Clear axis labels and title

---

## Running the Program from Python

If you want to run the source code directly:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
python GRAPH.py
```

---

## Executable Version (.exe)

The compiled Windows executable is named:

```
grafik.exe
```

It is located inside the archive:

```
Graphic Calculator
```

and published in this GitHub repository.

The executable version does **not require Python to be installed**.

---

## How to Build the EXE Yourself

To build the executable manually:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile GRAPH.py
```

The final `.exe` file will appear in the `dist` folder.

---

## Educational Value

This project can be used for:

* School geometry projects
* Demonstration of coordinate systems
* Learning numerical modeling
* Introduction to scientific visualization
